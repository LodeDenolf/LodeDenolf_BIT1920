DB(PersonnelNumber,Name,Date_of_birth,LabCode,LabName,ResearchCode,ResearchDescription,ResaerchSupervisor)

NF1
--> each cell single value
--> enteries in column have same type
--> Rows are uniquely identified

DB(PersonnelNumber,Name,Date_of_birth,LabCode,LabName,ResearchCode,ResearchDescription,ResaerchSupervisor)

NF2
--> all atributes (non-key columns) dependent on the key

the primary key in the main table will be PersonnelNumber
LabName, ResearchDescription and ResaerchSupervisor tells us nothing about the PersonnelNumber
we will put them in different tables: one that tells us information about the lab and one that tells us information over the research
the primary key of the lab table will be LabCode and the primary key of research wil be ResearchCode

DB(PersonnelNumber,Name,Date_of_birth,LabCode,ResearchCode) 
DB(LabCode,LabName)
DB(ResearchCode,ResearchDescription,ResaerchSupervisor)

NF3
--> all fields (columns) can be determined only by the Primary Key in the table and no other column

this is already OK there are no columns left that are not determined on there primary key

DB(PersonnelNumber,Name,Date_of_birth,LabCode,ResearchCode) 
DB(LabCode,LabName)
DB(ResearchCode,ResearchDescription,ResaerchSupervisor)
